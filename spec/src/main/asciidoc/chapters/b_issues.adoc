[appendix]
== Issues

The following sections document the more
noteworthy issues that have been discussed by the Expert Group. These
sections are included in the Final Release as they provide insight into
the discussions and decisions which shaped the form of the current
specification. All of these issues have been resolved, and their
resolutions are described below and reflected in the document.

=== Configuration Context and Policy Context Identifiers

The `PolicyConfiguration` interface associates
Configuration Context Identifiers with policy statements, which
themselves contain embedded policy context identifiers. There needs to
be more explanation of the purpose and use models of these context
identifiers. Configuration context identifiers should only be assigned
by the Provider, to eliminate problems with ambiguity. In the case of
createRole, we allow a configuration context identifier to be passed to
createRole so that one configuration context id can be used for all of
the roles in an application/module. It would probably be a good idea to
allow the unchecked and excluded policy collections to also share the
same context id. This would reduce the complexity of the identity
mapping, but it would make it harder for the provider to ensure
uniqueness of identifiers. We also want to support deployment and
undeployment of modules, within a multi-module policy configuration
context. That is, the modules share the same roles, but their individual
policy statements are differentiated by policy context id within these
roles.

*Note -* Regarding policy context identifiers, it will not be possible to
surgically replace the policy statements corresponding to a module, if
modules within a policy configuration context share the same policy
context identifiers.

image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -* `The PolicyConfiguration` interface has been redesigned to support both
the factory and finder patterns, and to include an `inService` method to
allow a container to check if a `PolicyConfiguration` with a given
identifier already exists. The interface also includes the concept of
linked `PolicyConfigurations` to identify those `PolicyConfigurations` that
must share the same principal-to-role mappings.

[[a780]]
=== Configuration of Permissions with Parameters

The `PolicyConfiguration` interface is used to
communicate policy statements to `Policy`. An element of these statements
is a `PermissionCollection` that may contain `EJBMethodPermission` and
`EJBRoleRefPermission` objects that may have been constructed with
embedded references to argument arrays or `EntityBean` instances. The
contract must state whether such permissions may be passed through the
`PolicyConfiguration` interface, and what the responsibility of the
provider shall be should it occur.


image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution (Partial) -* resolved via the introduction of `PolicyContext` handlers and the
corresponding removal of the ability to include such information in
permission constrictions.

image:authz-4.png[image]

=== Extensibility of the PolicyConfiguration Interface

For example, the `PolicyConfiguration`
interface does not include methods that may be used to interrogate
`Policy` to determine the list of configured policy configuration
contexts. We should also consider whether the interface should be
extended to support the configuration of additional forms (other than
unchecked, and excluded) logical policy statements



image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution (Partial) -* with the change to finder semantics, that is
`getPolicyConfiguration`, and the addition of the `inService` method to
`PolicyConfigurationFactory`.

image:authz-4.png[image]

=== Directory Scoped Extension matching patterns

image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -* We will not require that they be supported by policy providers, nor will
we require that policy providers reject other than the patterns defined
by Jakarta Servlet.

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a788]]
=== Evolution of Deployment Policy Language

The Policy Configuration and Policy Decision
Subcontracts should be generalized to sustain evolution in the
declarative authorization policy representations used in deployment
descriptors. One dimension of this evolution, would be a change from
DTDs to schema.


image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -* Some generalization in the `PolicyConfiguration` interface has occurred as
a result of the removal of policy context identifiers from permissions
such that any permission objects may be configured through this
interface.

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a791]]
=== Principals Passed to Providers in Subjects

The provider is expected to do
principal-to-role mapping, but we have not allowed the provider to
assume that it is working with a companion authentication module. We
have also not defined standard principals for containers to put in the
subjects used when they ask `Policy` to make decisions for them. So, it is
unclear how providers will be able to do Principal-to-Role mapping.



image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  We decoupled consideration of this issue from notions of principal
selection imposed by the `getCallerPrincipal` and `getUserPrincipal` methods
of Jakarta Enterprise Beans and Jakarta Servlet respectively. We clarified that all principals in an
`AccessControlContext` shall be available to the policy module for use in
principal to role mapping. We added a requirement with respect to
asserting or vouching authorities to ensure that principals
corresponding to authorities are not misinterpreted by providers as
principals of the subject (see <<a736>>). Moreover, we concluded that independent
of this contract, a policy module must be familiar with the principals
(i.e. security attributes) assigned to subjects as the result of
authentication in its operational environment and for which it must
evaluate policy.

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a794]]
=== Clarification of Jakarta Servlet Constraint Matching Semantics

The definition of the `security-constraint`
matching and enforcement semantics were under specified in the historical 
pre-Jakarta Servlet 2.2 and 2.3 specifications. The contract defined in this document has
clarified these semantics; however there was an issue until these
clarifications were incorporated into the pre-Jakarta Servlet.

image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -* The pre-Jakarta Servlet 2.4 specification and onwards include a more complete description of
the processing of constraints.

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a797]]
=== References and Arguments in EJBMethodPermisison

When a container constructs an
`EJBMethodPermission` as part of its policy decision subcontract, it may
include a reference to the Jakarta Enterprise Bean (for an EntityBean) and the arguments to
the method in the constructed permission. Inclusion of this additional
context by containers is optional for performance reasons, yet it has
been suggested that the contract provide a way (perhaps via a callback
or an exception thrown by the provider) for the container to find out
whether or not such information would be used by the provider.


image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -* Resolved with introduction of policy context handlers

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a800]]
=== Permission Spanning in RoleRefPermission

The `EJBRoleRefPermission` and
`WebRoleRefPermission` objects support the checking of multiple
“references” in a single permission check. This functionality was
motivated by recurring requests to extend the Jakarta EE “inRole” APIs to
allow multiple role references to be evaluated in a single call. The
permission classes noted above, currently support this functionality, at
the cost of having to span permissions in collection implication. The
most direct consequence of this spanning is that the new Permission
Collection methods of these Permission classes must not return null, as
they must return a `PermissionCollection` capable of doing the permission
specific spanning.



image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  The replacement paradigm has been changed such that it should no longer
be possible for providers to depend on custom implementations of the
permission classes defined by this specification. Accordingly, the
complexity introduced by spanning should be attenuated in a compatible
implementation.

image:authz-4.png[image]


[[a806]]
=== PolicyContext Identifiers are Unknown to Components

Although not strictly speaking within the
scope of this specification, the work of this specification empowers application components
to use the Java SE policy decision interface to perform their own access
control decisions. The permissions defined by this specification must be
constructed with an embedded policy context identifier so that the
policy provider can evaluate the permission in the proper deployment
context (i.e policy configuration). As currently defined, the
specification does not provide a component with access to its policy
configuration identifiers, and as such a component can not check any
permissions which implement the `PolicyContext` interface.


image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  resolved by moving policy context identifiers out of the permissions,
into the `PolicyContext` utility class

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a809]]
=== JAAS Policy Interface expects Providers to be able to getPermissions

Not all Policy providers can, or find it
convenient or efficient, to determine all of the permissions granted to
an access control context. The JAAS Policy decision interface, and the
use of this interface by the JAAS `SubjectDomainCombiner`, impede the
integration of Policy Providers that are unable to enumerate all the
permissions that pertain to a subject/protection domain before returning
from `Policy.getPermissions()`.

image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  Added recommendation to <<a173>>] that the
_javax.security.auth.SubjectDomainCombiner_ of an application
server must _combine_ into the permission collection returned by
_javax.security.auth.Policy.getPermisions_.

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a812]]
=== Implementing Web Security Constraints as Permission

Specification of the `WebResourcePermission`
and `WebUserDataPermission` classes with simple, single URL pattern names
is a bad fit for the Java SE Policy decision interface. The
implementation of `getPermissions` presents a major challenge, as the
constraint model would force the implementation to preserve ungranted
constraining permissions in the returned `PermissionCollection`. It also
would not be possible to implement the enumeration functionality
available through the elements method of the collection. Perhaps more
significant, the mapping of security constraints to simple, single URL
pattern names would require a special more complex Policy provider rule
combining algorithm, and as such, would render the default Java Policy
provider incompetent to process such permissions. The last point is in
direct conflict with a stated goal of the specification.


image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  The translation of web security constraints into Java SE permissions was
modified such that the URL pattern names of the `WebResource` and
`WebUserData` permissions include a representation of the URL patterns to
which the permission does NOT apply. The permission implies logic was
enhanced to take this change into account. As a result of these changes
these permissions may be processed by the default Java SE Policy module
like any other Java SE permission.

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a815]]
=== Exception Handling

The first PFD did not define error handling
for the methods of the `PolicyConfigurationFactory` and `PolicyContext`
classes, or for the `PolicyConfiguration` and `PolicyContextHandler`
interfaces. Also, no provision was provided for implementation classes
to pass checked exceptions out through the defined interfaces and
classes.


image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  A `PolicyContextException` class was added to the `jakarta.security.jacc`
package, and the methods of the classes and interfaces identified above
were modified to throw this checked exception as appropriate.

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a818]]
=== PolicyConfiguration Commit

The first PFD did not provide a way for
container deployment tools to indicate when the translation of a policy
context was complete and available for assimilation into the associated
Policy provider. It had been assumed that the `Policy.refresh` method
could serve this purpose, until it was discovered that depending on
`Policy.refresh` for this purpose would preclude parallelism in the
deployment of applications.


image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  Added "commit" and “inService” methods to the `PolicyConfiguration`
interface, and formalized a 3 state (i.e. open, inService, and deleted)
life cycle for policy contexts. Required that the commit method be
called on a `PolicyConfiguration` object after all of its policy
statements have been added, and after it is "linked to any other module
with which it must share the same principal-to-role mapping". Also
required that `Policy.refresh` only assimilate policy contexts in the
“inService” state.

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a821]]
=== Support for ServiceEndpoint methodInterface

The definition of the `EJBMethodPermission`
class in the first PFD did not support “ServiceEndpoint" as a valid
methodInterface value. The `ServiceEndpoint` methodInterface was
introduced by pre-Jakarta Enterprise Beans 2.1.


image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  Added “ServiceEndpoint” as another possible value for the
methodInterface component of an `EJBMethodPermission` methodNameSpec.

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a824]]
=== TypeNames of EJBMethodPermission Array Parameters

The syntax or syntaxes that may be used to
specify array parameters are not defined by the constructors of the
`EJBMethodPermission` class. The corresponding canonical form of such
params as returned by `getActions` must also be specified.



image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  Added requirement that `Array` parameters be specified as `ComponentType[]`
as opposed to in the form returned by `Class.getName()` (i.e.
`[LComponentType;`).

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a827]]
=== Checking Permission on the root of a Web Application

The `URLPattern`, "/", cannot be used to check
a permission, as it is a synonym for asking if permission to access the
entire application has been granted.


image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  Require that the empty string be used as a replacement for "/", during
the permission evaluation. Clarify the `WebResourcePermission` and
`WebUserDataPermission` definitions to account for the use of the
empty-string as a legitimate `URLPattern` in such permissions.

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a830]]
=== Calling isUserInRole from JSP not mapped to a Servlet

Checking a `WebRoleRefPermission` requires the
name of a Jakarta Servlet to identify the scope of the reference to role
translation. The name of a scoping servlet has not been established for
an unmapped Jakarta Server Page.



image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  For every security role in the web application add a
`WebRoleRefPermission` to the corresponding role. The name of all such
permissions shall be the empty string, and the actions of each
permission shall be the corresponding role name. When checking a
`WebRoleRefPermission` from a Web resource not mapped to a servlet, use a
permission with the empty string as its name and with the argument to
`isUserInRole` as its actions.

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a833]]
=== Support for HTTP Extension Methods

Pre-Jakarta Servlet 2.5 added support for HTTP extension
methods (as defined in IETF RFC 2616 "Hypertext Transfer Protocol --
HTTP/1.1") to `security-constraints`. Support for extension methods
requires changes to the `WebResourcePermission` and `WebUserDataPermission`
classes and to the translation of servlet security-constraints. In
general support for HTTP extension methods requires an ability to
represent non-enumerable HTTP method sets in the HTTPMethodSpec
components of WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission actions
values.



image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  Modified the HTTPMethodSpec constructs of `WebResourcePermission` and
`WebUserDataPermission` to support an HTTPMethodExceptionList as a third
form of HTTPMethodSpec. This resolution is known to have the following
consequences with respect to backward compatibility: 1) A permission
constructed with an HTTPMethodSpec composed of an HTTPMethodList
containing all the "standard" HTTP methods (i.e.,
"DELETE,GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,POST,PUT,TRACE) is no longer equal to and no
longer implies a permission constructed with a null, empty array, or
emptyString HTTPMethodSpec. 2) Permissions constructed with a null,
empty array, or emptyString HTTPMethodSpec component to their actions
value represent the non-enumerable (due to extension methods) set of all
possible HTTP methods and are NOT equal to or implied by any permission
constructed with an HTTPMethodSpec represented as an HTTPMethodList. 3)
It is no longer possible to use the HTTPMethodList syntax to represent
(via enumeration) the complement of a proper subset of all HTTP methods.
As such, an HTTPMethodExceptionList must be used to represent any proper
subset of HTTP methods determined NOT to be constrained during the
translation of servlet `security-constraints`. 4) The use of exception
lists causes the permissions resulting from the translation of a given
security-constraint configuration to differ in their actions values from
those that would have been produced prior to support for HTTP extension
methods. Previously translated permissions remain supported by the
changed permission implementations, and (with the exceptions listed in 1
and 2 above) continue to function as they did before the change, as long
as extension methods are not set in checked permissions.

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a836]]
=== Welcome File and security-constraint Processing

The relationship between welcome file
processing (which can modify the effective request URI) and
`security-constraint` processing is not defined by the Jakarta Servlet
Specification. Since this specification uses `url-patterns` derived from
request URIs to name target resources in checked permissions, it is
important that welcome file processing and its relationship to
`security-constraint` processing be clearly specified. Without a clear
description of this relationship, unprotected request URIs which are
modified to yield effective request URIs for protected resources may
inadvertently be left unprotected.


image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  pending Jakarta Servlet clarification. Recommend that Jakarta Servlet standarize an
`HttpServletRequest` attribute that can be used to portably obtain the
`requestURI` following welcome file mapping. Once this attribute is
standardized, The `HttpServletRequest` based constructors of
`WebResourcePermission` and `WebUserDataPermission` would use its value to
establish the permission name.

image:authz-4.png[image]

[[a839]]
=== Colons Within path-segment of Request URI

As defined in IETF RFC 2396 "Uniform Resource
Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax", the abs_path component of a request
URI may consist of a sequence of "/" separated path segments, where the
format of each segment is defined as follows:

```
segment = *pchar *( ";" param )
param = *pchar
pchar = unreserved | escaped |":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | ","
```

A colon character occurring within a
path-seqment will be syntactically indistinguishable from colons used by
the `WebResourcePermission` and `WebUserDataPermission` constructors to
demarcate qualifying patterns.


image:authz-4.png[image]

*Resolution -*  Require that containers use escaped encoding (as defined in RFC 2396) on
colon characters occuring within `url-patterns` obtained from `web.xml`.
Also require that containers encode colons occuring within patterns
extracted from `HttpServletRequest` objects and used to create the names
of checked `WebResourcePermission` and `WebUserDataPermission` objects. Also
require the `HttpServletRequest` based constructors of
`WebResourcePermission` and `WebUserDataPermission` apply escaped encoding
to colons occuring in the names the derived from the request URI. Note
that the colon character is represented as %3A in escaped encoding.
